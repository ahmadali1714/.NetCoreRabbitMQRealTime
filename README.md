This repository contains two distinct projects:

.NET Core Web API

Windows Service

Both projects leverage a MS SQL Server database for data management and facilitate real-time communication using RabbitMQ service. The .NET Core project utilizes ADO.NET, while the Windows Service employs Entity Framework Core, ensuring both ORM methodologies are demonstrated within the repository.
